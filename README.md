### Reflection ###
Well, this project ended up being both a blessing and a curse. To be honest, I'm starting to realize just why a dev's job can be so hard. Even though this layout only took a few hours, when you consider in having to add in click functionality, server calls, form submissions, and everything else, it's utterly insane how despite how simple this all looks, how much MORE work would be required to even add functionality to a page.

As for my own reflection:
I definitely cheated on the Announcements and Trending sections, while this was simply a design assignment, it definitely would NOT work in a real-world situation, but I wanted to challenge myself to be as barebones as possible and see what I could accomplish with styling, even if it was just fake.

I think some parts of this went really well. Grid definitely seems to be useful for 2d styling, and flexbox is of course, always great for its simplicity. I really like how grid doesn't seem to leave me with lots of questions, it just seems to work how I expect it to. Even now, I struggle to understand how to make flexbox do what I want it to do. I can't say I really like it very much, despite the usefulness it has.

The other big thing I learned doing this (which I remember hearing about from a frontend dev friend) was that despite how much I tried to organize, everything became sort of a disaster (although I think it was overall relatively well organized - I hope I can look back on this 6 months-1 year from now and laugh). The margin/border/padding situations can quickly spiral out of control, and I think I need to re-study on how each of those affect the document.

Overall, webdev is so much harder than I thought. This project made me realize that even if it looks...alright, there's still such a riduculously long way to go.

Never give up.
